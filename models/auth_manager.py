# models/auth_manager.py
# This class is primarily conceptual in the provided diagram and its core logic
# (hashing, token creation/validation) is typically handled by utilities
# or integrated directly into FastAPI's security dependencies.
# This file serves as a placeholder if more complex authentication state management
# beyond JWTs and session is required within the models layer.

class AuthManager:
    """
    사용자 회원가입, 로그인, 로그아웃을 처리하는 클래스이다.
    사용자 리스트를 속성으로 가지며, 인증 절차에 따라 User 객체를 관리한다.
    SessionManager와 연동되어 현재 로그인된 사용자를 설정하고, 회원가입 시 중복된 사용자 이름이 존재하는지 확인한다.
    (Note: In a FastAPI application, much of this logic is handled by path operations
    and security dependencies like OAuth2PasswordBearer, making a separate
    AuthManager class less critical at the ORM/model layer, but good for conceptual design.)
